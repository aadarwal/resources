## Training_Data
This is everything that I have learned in terms of formal academic work throughout my life and it is what consists of the primary knowledge framework for yatharth. 
I think anyone can learn this stuff are and while I have never really placed importance on doing well in classes I think this is an important method for having good training data for solving research problems and working on new ideas, which imo are the most beautiful reasons to learn this stuff in the first place. This is a mix of memorised information and reference information, precisely what I thoink is the point of training data for humans. 

## Formalised Knowledge

**Physics**

*Typical Classwork* (by Sophomore Year)

Quantum Mechanics: 
1. Lecture Series on Quantum Physics, Prof.V.Balakrishnan, Video Lectures, https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0F530F3BAF8C6FCC&si=jxO12bnFzj7oxyPh
I think this might be the most incredible way to learn quantum mechanics, because it is basically all of the math and physics approaches that I had to get across a bunch of classes at Chicago collapsed into incredible and great teaching.
