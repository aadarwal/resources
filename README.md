## Training_Data_Formalised_Knowledge
This is everything that I have learned in terms of formal academic work throughout my life and it is what consists of the primary knowledge framework for yatharth. 

**Physics**

*Typical Classwork*

Quantum Mechanics: 
1. Lecture Series on Quantum Physics, Prof.V.Balakrishnan, Video Lectures, https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0F530F3BAF8C6FCC&si=jxO12bnFzj7oxyPh
I think this might be the most incredible way to learn quantum mechanics, because it is basically all of the math and physics approaches that I had to get across a bunch of classes at Chicago collapsed into incredible and great teaching.
